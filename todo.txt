_ create a new .sh configuration file that specifies the apex version instead of modifying the run_db_app_deployments.sh script.  






_ rename the docker image to have a pifsc prefix instead of a noaa prefix
	_ rename the container names:
		_ auto_db_app_deploy
		_ db_container
		_ ords_apex


_ update the documentation to reference the authorization key instead of logging in to oracle container registry with the username/password


_ Update the versions of Oracle XE and ORDS-Developer in this repo and then allow the downstream repos to pull those changes to propagate the changes

_ look into the DB/APEX configuration files from Gwo


X VS Code can be used for markdown

X document the login to oracle registry

_ remove traceroute from dockerfile

_ update the ords-developer image (implement dockerfile) to copy the conn_string.txt file into the appropriate folder so it doesn't disappear each time the container is run
	
_ set pwd in ENV file

_ pull the upstream README.md changes into the repo



git bash commands:

cd /c/Users/jesse.abdul/Documents/Version\ Control/Git/pifsc-oracle-developer-environment/deployment_scripts

bash prepare_docker_project.sh
bash build_deploy_project_dev.sh



troubleshooting tips:
	If the project is not working as expected when it is prepared using prepare_docker_project.sh:
		for dev: is the correct branch being specified in the ODE or resource (e.g. DSC, CAS) URL?
		Is the branch spelled correctly?
	Is the project_config.sh correct?
		Does it point at a different project_folder_name than the prepared directory?
		
		


bugs:
	_ copy the conn_string.txt to the container each time it runs
		create a dockerfile for the ords-developer image
		
	Issue with the image not being able to download from the container registry
	



	
X Provide 2 different configurations:
	X persistent data (for development sessions)
		as DB data model is adjusted during development and APEX app is being developed/adjusted/tested
	X non-persistent data (for CI/CD or testing deployment database)
	
	

X Preparation script
	X How do we leverage the existing Git projects?
		X Git clone the repo(s) and copy the SQL folder contents into appropriate subfolders (e.g. DSC, CAS, CCD, etc.)
	
	X Provide a default script (e.g. run_db_app_deployments.sh)	in the docker container that can be customized to execute specific scripts in the container
		
To do:
	Documentation:
		X How to prepare the projects
		X The requirements of any shared database schemas that need to be included in a given Oracle data system
		X How to fork and customize the project
		
	
	_ build out the DSC example first
		_ get an export of all objects in the DSC schema from production
	_ build out the CAS example next
	_ build out the PARR Tools example next
	_ Then build out the generalized upstream repo that can be forked for any given data system and that the upstream changes can be pulled moving forward
	_ fork the generalized docker stack repo to create the DSC and CAS repos

	** X when we check if the schemas have been deployed, simply query to see if the expected schema exists or not, if not then run all of the deployment scripts if so just shutdown the container


	Run with database only?
		Maybe don't need that because any container scenario with an application would probably have some type of container attached to it for communication purposes
		We don't want to create every scenario of application server, it's not feasible or sensible
		
	for CI/CD purposes we would use a container with an appropriate programming language (e.g. PHP for PHPUnit)
		For testing we would want to look into PL/SQL unit testing framework so we can code coverage statistics
